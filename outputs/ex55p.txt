We are working to solve the Generalised Fermat Equation 1 *x^ 5  +  7 *y^ 5  =  1 *z^p 

We assume the following assumptions on a putative solution (a, b, c): 

Is ab even? false
Is c even? true
Is ab divisible by r? false
Is c divisible by r? true
Is the polynomial gminus irreducible over Qr? false
