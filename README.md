# effective_Darmon

Electronic ressources for the preprint "Effective Darmon's program for the Generalised Fermat Equation", by Martin Azon.

Files are organised as follows:

"Frey_curves.m" contains the necessary functions to compute the defining polynomials of the curves and their traces of Frobenius.

"Elimination_functions.m" contains the necessary functions to eliminate a given newform, at least asymptotically. 

"ex1_pp5.m" contains the code for solving the infinite family of Generalised Fermat Equations 7x^p + y^5 = 3z^p, under 2-adic and 5-adic conditions. Its output is stored in the file "ex1_pp5.txt".

"ex1_55p.m" contains the code for solving the infinite family of Generalised Fermat Equations x^5 + 7y^5 = z^p, under 2-adic and 5-adic conditions. Its output is stored in the file "ex1_55p.txt".
