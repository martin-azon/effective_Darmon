This repository contains a Magma package to perform the elimination step as explained in the preprint

Effective Darmon's program for the generalised Fermat equation,
by Martin Azon, available at 
https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01967

To use this Magma package, download it and load the file "main.m".

In the file "main.m", the user may introduce his choice of parameters that corresponds to a family of generalised Fermat equations of signature (p, p, r) or (r, r, p).
The package then performs the necessary computations to discard isomorphisms of Galois representations corresponding to Frey Jacobians and Hilbert newforms.
The package produces an output file whose content is a proof for the fact that the given equation has no primitive non-trivial solutions. 

In the outputs folder, the user will find ouptut files for some examples of signatures (p, p, 5) and (5, 5, p).

Please report any bugs or suggested improvements!
